# Style-Guide

**`Notice: this guide is still in development!`**

This document is there to outline the development principles, style and quality of code. The goal of this guide is to homogenies the codebase. This guide will not be enforced to the letter but rather to it's spirit.

## Project Goals

The main goal of the project is to provide an intuitive [Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/sdk-vs-api) for the [Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE)](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve).

The secondary goal of the project is to provide a [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) to interact with the PVE. A goal of this CLI is provide implementation examples of this SDK.

### Command Line Interface
